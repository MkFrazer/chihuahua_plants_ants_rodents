#Background
Plants have a variety of predators, including ants and rodents. In order to better understand the possible additive or synergistic interactions of these predator groups, we used the data collected by Ernest et al. (2009) to analyze how the exclusion of ant colonies, rodents, or both influenced plant species diversity on plots in the Chichuahuan desert.
