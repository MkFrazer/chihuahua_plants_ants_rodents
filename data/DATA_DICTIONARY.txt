This Data Dictionary explains the file formatting for the CLEANED DATA for the project, 
"Plant Species Diversity as a function of ant and rodent predation in the Chihuahua desert."

ANTS

Ants_clean contains filtered data from the Ants_raw directory. 
The new .csv file contains a merged table of the following variables from years 1977-2002:
-YEAR: Year the data were collected, ranging from 1977-2002 (Integer)
-PLOT: Plot number where data were collected, 1-24 (Integer)
-[Species code]: Number of colonies or colony opening, 0 = no colonies or openings present, -99 = presence/absence not recorded (Integer)
Although data for each stake was recorded starting in 1988, before 1988, only plot totals were recorded (totals for all 49 stakes) for each species.
